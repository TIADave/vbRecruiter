We also like the OH to be able to attack from the back row as well, so having someone who’s comfortable with their ball control is important. MH- We are looking for a MH that likes to run off one foot to attack. She needs to have quick feet and a fast arm as well. We love to set slides and other various one foot attacking sets, so having someone that can chase and get on the ball quick is important. We would like her to be approach touching at 10’ or above so that she can be successful at blocking as well. Competitive drive is also important in this position. Our middles work hard so we can get them the ball so they lots of effort and grit. RS- We are looking for a 2 foot attacker that can terminate at the pin. She can hit 2nd tempo balls as well as traditional behind the setter sets. She needs to be a blocking presence. Foot speed is good, but fast arm and hitting a heavy ball is more important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;SCHOLARSHIP?

    <Description>Georgia Tech is one of the top public universities in the United States playing in one of the top volleyball conferences in the NCAA. It is a unique blend of top tier academics and high level volleyball. Georgia Tech is ranked #7 among public universities in the country by U.S. News &amp; World Report, and the Georgia Tech College of Engineering is consistently ranked in the nation’s top five by the magazine. In 2014, Tech was ranked #1 smartest public college by Business Insider magazine. Georgia Tech has the best of both worlds — a traditional and beautiful 400-acre campus located in a major city. Within the thriving, creative metropolis of Atlanta, Georgia, Tech’s Midtown neighborhood is home to young professionals, families, students, and the city’s main central source of green space, Piedmont Park. The campus is next door to businesses, museums, theaters, restaurants, and retail stores. In addition to its inexhaustible source of cultural and entertainment options, Atlanta is a great city for a college. Tech’s Atlanta location will play an integral part in your education, by putting you in close proximity to real-world projects, valuable co-op jobs, and meaningful internships.</Description>

We expect the 2016 class to define our program for several years. Looking for a starting level setter, looking for a power hitting outside or right-side hitter, looking for a ball-control OH (L2) and a middle blocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:&lt;/b&gt; Setter – run a strong middle-oriented offense, accurate and consistent in her delivery while jump-setting most every ball. Blocking height is a factor since we run a 5-1. Power hitter (OH or RS) – 5-10 or bigger, powerful enough to beat the block at the net, disadvantage the defense out of the back row and put up a strong block. MB (5-11 or bigger) – an imposing blocker, long and agile enough to impose all along the net. A strong hitter, able to run a variety of quick attacks in both serve receive and transition. L2 (5-8 or bigger) – looking for a dynamic player who can hold their own at the net while providing libero-type passing and defense. DS – provides precise ball control passing and digging, aggressive and quick enough to cover more than their share of the court. At all positions we value length, athleticism, intelligence and aggressiveness, players who are good students and great teammates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;SCHOLARSHIP? Marietta is an NCAA D-III college and, thus, does not offer athletic scholarships. We do, however, offer academic scholarships, merit grants and a full array of need-based aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017 NEEDS:&lt;/b&gt; Looking for upgrades at any position, players who can compete at the National level in D-III. Setter, power outside or right-side hitter, middle blocker, ball control OH or DS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:&lt;/b&gt; Setter – starting potential at 2 positions (e.g., setter/DS, or setter/RS). Accurate and consistent jump-setter, able to run a quick tempo, middle-oriented offense. Power hitter (OH or RS) – 5-10 or bigger, powerful enough to beat the block at the net, disadvantage the defense hitting out of the back row and put up a strong block. MB (5-11 or bigger) – an imposing blocker, long and agile enough to impose all along the net. A strong hitter, able to run a variety of quick attacks in both serve receive and transition. L2 and/or DS – 5-8 or bigger, someone who passes and digs precisely while covering a large portion of the court and, at L2, can still hold their own at the net. At all positions we value length, athleticism, intelligence and aggressiveness, players who are good students and great teammates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;SCHOLARSHIP? Marietta is an NCAA D-III college and, thus, does not offer athletic scholarships. We do, however, offer academic scholarships, merit grants and a full array of need-based aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2018 NEEDS:&lt;/b&gt; We typically don’t recruit freshmen unless they are specifically interested in us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:&lt;/b&gt; At all positions we value length, athleticism, intelligence and aggressiveness, players who are good students and great teammates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;SCHOLARSHIP?

    <Description>Nicholls State University is a gem of school in Thibodaux, LA nestled on the bayou between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. South central Louisiana is like no place else on earth. Nothing here is done in half measures. People enjoy life to the fullest – the food, the sunshine, the quick hugs and easy laughter – which explains why we draw visitors from all over the world. Nicholls State University is very much an expression of this generous and embracing culture. We believe in a serious education delivered with gusto. That means intense learning, career preparations, fast friendships and an appetite for accomplishment. Total enrollment is approximately 7000 which makes for an ideal size and a balance of small class sizes and personal attention.</Description>

Libero, great vocal presence and guts, with passing 50% of the court being the primary focus, defense is important as well but passing is biggest focal point. M1 would need to be good off one foot behind with the length/athleticism to close blocks at a Top 15 level.&lt;br /&gt;</Html>

OH2 has to be able to ball control and hold her own in the FR and have great 6 rotation skill defensively and passing. Libero, great vocal presence and guts, with passing 50% of the court being the primary focus, defense is important as well but passing is biggest focal point. M1 would need to be good off one foot behind with the length/athleticism to close blocks at a Top 15 level.</Requirements>

    <Description>UT-Chattanooga is a medium-sized public university (approximately 10,000 undergrad students enrolled, in addition to around 1,000 graduate students) located less than a mile away from the heart of downtown Chattanooga, Tennessee.  Some of our strongest academic majors include Business (undergrad and MBA programs), Engineering, Nursing, Communications, Psychology, Biology, Chemistry, and Human &amp; Health Performance.  All of our on-campus housing options are apartment style and our college campus, which is truly a campus and completely separate from downtown, is in walking distance to one of the up-and-coming downtowns in the entire Southeast.  Recently voted as one of the top 5 places to live by “Outside Magazine” because of its LOCATION, climate, landscape, and outdoor activities, Chattanooga is located in the Tennessee Valley, with the Tennessee River cutting through the edge of downtown, and surrounded by mountains.  UTC offers an amazing opportunity to be a student-athlete at one of the “sleeping giants” in the Southeast, when it comes to a growing university and campus, an ultra-competitive mid-major Division I athletic department, and a vibrant, clean, and safe city!</Description>

    <Description>Whitman College is more than the sum of its parts. Interdisciplinary research opportunities. Small classes. Global connections forged under the guidance of dedicated faculty members. The support it takes to turn college into limitless opportunity. What Whitman College has, it shares. As a small, residential liberal arts college in Eastern Washington’s Walla Walla, Whitman has what it takes to provide an education that goes beyond the classroom. Whitties are scholars, but also explorers and scientists. They climb mountains, travel to far-off corners and advocate for social justice. They care about community and aim to become citizens of the world. A Whitman education is rooted in the traditional liberal arts values like critical thought and academic rigor; add in prestigious internships, off-campus study and civic engagement opportunities, and it becomes more than the sum of its parts. The Whitman experience transforms, allowing students to turn education into life.</Description>

    <PageText>PrepVolleyball.com is pleased to bring back our College Needs List, a look at those colleges that both have recruiting needs and the willingness to publish them.
Before our 2013 website makeover, the Needs List was something that was automated and an important part of Prep. With the ownership change as of last year, it will be automated again soon enough but was too important to delay. For now, we’re doing this old school, in a low-tech way.
Below please find the needs for 133 colleges and universities, including more than 45 in NCAA Division I, updated with seven new schools since last Friday. As you peruse the schools and their needs, please respect their special requirements. If a school seeks a middle 6-1 or taller and you are a 5-9 middle, that is not the school for you.
We will update the needs list every Friday, as necessary, both with new listings and with modifications to the original listings. New listings – following precisely the format below – as well as modifications should be sent to john@prepvolleyball.com and contain “College Needs List” in the subject line.
Thanks. And to those we hope to benefit by the return of the Needs List, both schools and prospective student athletes, we wish you best wishes on your journey to finding the right fit for you!
